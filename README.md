Be warned: This is a big old WIP. I'm also using this to learn Git, so if you dig into the commit history please don't hurt me.

TODO: Provide an overview of the project
 - Explain the purpose of the script
 - Describe the different environments (Coding, Hacking, Minimal Toolset)

TODO: Add instructions for running the script
 - How to use `main_setup.sh`
 - Prerequisites (e.g., sudo permissions, internet access)

TODO: Document any configurations or dependencies
 - List tools installed by each helper script
 - Highlight how to extend the script for new setups
